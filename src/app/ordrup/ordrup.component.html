            For Elevate Tech Jam 2019 Hackathon, my team and I created a
            scalable IoT point-of-sale for local businesses that simplifies the
            payment and dining experiences for customers. In short, our mission
            was to alleviate stress on small business who cannot afford to pay
            for sophisticated payment solutions.

            Problem Insight
          </h4>
          <p class="fs-20 text-black">
            Diving a bill for a large group of diners is a painstakingly
            difficult task for servers. As a customer, the time spent waiting
            for a server to bring you the cash machine is a frustrating
            experience. Businesses lose out on revenue if they canâ€™t provide
            convenient service.
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">The User Experience</h4>
          <p class="fs-20 text-black">
            We created an application that keeps track of individual guest's
            orders and allows servers to update and manage their tables. It also
            allows customers to choose their preferred method of payment and any
            point between verifying their order and leaving. All this without
            the bottle-neck of a debit machine or a busy server. Customers use
            NFC to tap their phones on a beacon at the restaurant table. Their
            server can then update their order through the app for the customer
            to view and verify. At any point after verification, the user can
            pay through either mobile payment and leave, or prompt the server
            that a card machine or cash payment is required.
          </p>

          <h4 class="mt-4">Next Steps</h4>
          <p class="fs-20 text-black">
            The next step for Ordrup would be potentially integrating Rogers IoT services to create a mesh IoT
            network. Also, we could add extra features to the
            app such as 'paying for someone else'.
